# Forecast Testing Tool

This project is designed to automate forecasting model testing by sending test requests, adjusting model parameters, saving results to Excel/JSON, and backing up the database state.

## Installation

Clone the repository and navigate into the project:

```bash

cd tester
```

Install dependencies using Poetry:

```bash

poetry install
```

Configure database and other settings inside `.env` file.


## Running the Application

Start the FastAPI application with:

```bash

poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8001 --reload
```

- API will be available at: `http://localhost:8001`
- Swagger UI (interactive API docs): `http://localhost:8001/docs`


## Features

- Initial Forecast Run (`/run-initial-test`)
- Multiple Parameterized Test Runs (`/run-multi-test`)
- Automatic parameter backup and restoration
- Saving results as Excel + JSON
- Full database backup (`ds_data` table)
- Organized backup folders by date


## Notes

- Results are stored under `/forecast_test_results.<date>/`
- Backups are stored under `/forecast_test_backups.<date>/`
- Large tables (millions of rows) might take some time to backup.

## Notes_2
- Full ds_data backups may be slow for large tables (2M+ rows).
- Parameter values are always reverted to original after each test.
- Forecasting errors are logged but won't stop the test sequence.
- The service is designed primarily for internal/company network use.

If you encounter any issues, check the logs inside the `/logs/` directory.

Happy Testing! ðŸš€
